## Supplemental materials
**DISCLAIMER**: these are *NOT* a substitute for attending lecture or the professor's assigned readings/assignments!
I am simply recommending resources I found useful and interesting when I was taking 40B and other related courses.



### Problem Sets
Presented without solution for obvious reasons. Problems reflect only part of SI sessions; they do not include the questions and discussions with students. The most meaningful parts of SI sessions are unscripted.
