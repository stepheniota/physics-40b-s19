\section{Conceptual Questions}

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
	\item Explain \textit{why} the gravitational potential energy between two masses is negative. Note: saying ``because that's what the equation gives'' is \textit{not} a valid answer.
	\item The escape speed from Planet X is 10,000 m/s. Planet Y has the same radius as Planet X, but is twice as dense. What is the escape speed from Planet Y?
	\item Explain what is a geosynchronous orbit is, and explain what are the necessary conditions for such an orbit.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Newton's Law of Gravitation}

A 20 kg sphere is at the origin and a 10 kg sphere is at x = 20 cm. At what position on the $x$-axis could you place a small mass such that the net gravitational force on it due to the spheres is zero?



 \section{Geosynchronous orbits on Mars}
 What are the speed and height of a geosynchronous satellite orbiting Mars? Mars rotates about its axis every 24.8 hours.

\section{Orbital Energetics}

Show that, for a satellite in a circular orbit, $K = -\frac{1}{2} U_G$.

\section{Raising a satellite}
How much work must be done to boost a 1000 kg communications satellite from a low earth orbit with $h = 300$ km to a geosynchronous orbit?



\section{Schwarzschild radius}

Nothing can escape the \textit{event horizon} of a black hole, not even light. You can think of the event horizon as being the distance from a black hole at which the escape speed is the speed of light $c = 3\text{e}8$ m/s, making all escapes impossible. What is the radius of the event horizon for a black hole with a mass 5.0 times the mass of the sun? This distance is called the \textit{Schwarzschild radius}.
